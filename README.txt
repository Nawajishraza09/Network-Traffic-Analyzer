Introduction

Network traffic analysis Tool (NTA) is a critical component in modern cybersecurity. It involves monitoring, capturing, and analyzing network traffic to detect and mitigate potential threats and anomalies. 
The objective of this project is to develop a robust Network Traffic Analyzer that can monitor, analyze, and detect potential security threats within a network. 
This tool will leverage packet sniffing techniques to capture network traffic, employ data visualization to display traffic patterns, and utilize machine learning 
algorithms to identify anomalies and suspicious activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance network security by providing real-time alerts for potential threats. 
Python Programming language has been used in building NTA Tool project. 

Objective

1. Develop a packet sniffing module to capture real-time network traffic. 
2. Implement data visualization techniques to represent network traffic patterns.  
3. Integrate machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and potential security threats.  
4. Provide real-time alerts for suspicious activities. 

Libraries/Tools Used 

1. Scapy for capturing network packets/traffic. 
2. Matplotlib for creating visual representation of network traffic. 
3. Sklearn-IsolationForest for detecting anomalies and potential security threats. 
4. Smtplib used for real-time alert system for suspicious activites.
